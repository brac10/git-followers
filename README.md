## The Task: Github user's followers search
This assignment consists of creating a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub user's followers, display the followers avatar and total number of followers.
Also, I had to handle users with a lot of followers by adding a "Load More" button.


Visually, this assignment has the following elements:

* Input: a input field where the user types his username to search for his followers.
* Results: on a successful search the followers avatar will be shown with the their username. 

Note: if a user have more than 30 followers, a "Load More" button will appear, by clicking it, it will request the next 30 followers of the user from GitHub API

* Bonus: â€‹an autocomplete feature was added to the search of a username to help you find usernames easily


### Project Core
* This app is a single page app with a single `index.html`
linking to external JS/CSS.
* Libraries - jQuery, jQuery UI.
* Mobile first approach.
* Consist with the JavaScript Module Pattern.
